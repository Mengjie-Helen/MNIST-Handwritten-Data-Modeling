# MNIST-Handwritten-Data-Modeling

Description 

The MNIST database of handwritten digits is one of the most commonly used dataset for training various image processing systems and machine learning algorithms. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. MNIST is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. The original black and white (bilevel) images from MNIST were size normalized. We developed several classification methods including KNN, AdaBoost, SVM and some deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Network to do pattern recognition and predict what that digit is. And cross-entropy error and miss-classification error to improve models and judge which model is better.
